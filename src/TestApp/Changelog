Fixed JUnit Testing when Test File has been deleted

Fixed deleting JUnit tests that are used by other JUnit Tests.
    It will still delete the test from dropbox if nothing else uses it.
Uploading a JUnit Test now shows remote name instead of local name.
JUnit tests will now append a number to the filename if this is already a test with the same name.
Fixed 'ghost' data when removing and readding JUnit Tests.
