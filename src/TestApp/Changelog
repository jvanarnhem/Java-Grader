Added way to download and modify JUnit Test (and even listens for modifications and uploads when modifications exist)

    The JUnit modification is really really fancy.
Now handles JUnit tests with packages
Closing the main application now submits data from all open overlays
Realized JUnit only fails under certain configurations
    Need to test more under those configurations
