Unit testing is now functional, has a basic UI and will grade assignments automatically upon opening

Added method parsing (all java files now have their methods parsed)
Added additional cases to check for dependencies
Assignments now store unit tests 
Added UI for adding unit tests when editing assignments
Text under not INIC grades is always black now
Assignments now store total points
Added UI for total points per assignment (can't type letters)
Grade now has to be a double (can't type letters)
    Unfortunately this means any grades that aren't a decimal will disappear when updating
Unit testing is now functional
    It is not on another thread (so it slows down startup if there are a lot of unit tests to run)
    There can only be 1 test per assignment at the moment (it will either give full credit or no credit)
    Description of why tests failed is ok
    The GUI to add tests is ok, but doesn't check for propper commas and doesn't allow specifying all things
Fixed bug where writing code output could get stuck (although I don't think it ever occured)
Parsing java files is slightly faster now
    Previously injected code then reparsed the file, but since we stopped injecting code a while ago we don't need to reparse the file anymore
Refactored evaluation of lines
    Evaluates for dependencies and methods while taking into account comments
    Next step is to group multi-line method declarations...
Cleaned up running java code slightly
Added a ton of data structures and classes for unit testing
Fixed crash running application under certain conditions where a alert dialog would be invoked from the EDT
