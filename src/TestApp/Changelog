Removed Ignored Setting for Checkboxes in Simple Unit Testing because it was redundant and confusing

Updated readme.md with more direct link to builds and a bit more information.
UnitTesting now validates strings to double check there are no delimiters in there (although it is very unlikely that there is, but its good to make sure)
Improved method not found error in simple unit tests to include the method access and modifiers required.
Fixed ghost text fields a bit
Text files now save when they are modified.
Modified JSyntaxPane package to fix an annoying popup from a broken script (which would continue to popup until you restarted your computer oddly enough).
