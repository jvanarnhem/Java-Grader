Redid Simple Unit Tests Gui

Simple Unit Tests Gui now is like a method call that you define.
    Now uses Ghost Fields instead of JLabels that take up a ton of space.
Added Ghost Text Field Class
Fixed a few exceptions being thrown.
Fixed the way I was relaying streams because I was an idiot and didn't fully understand streams (and also fixed a bunch of bugs as a result of that).
Fixed compile error causing it to think a proccess was still running.
Fixed memory leaks where popups would never get their memory reclaimed.
Refactored ViewManager (Now possible to close overlays from it, lots of other improvements such as window tiling...)
