Implemented late assignment detection/resubmit detection

Detects late assignments being manually graded.
    Defaults to half the total points (on todo list to make configurable)
Unit testing also detects late assignments
    Automatically takes off 50%
Assignments now store their duedate
Added a library for a calendar picker (and a bunch of other swing components).
Fixed bug in dates.
When modifying assignments you can now set the duedate
Unit Tested assignments can no longer be graded from the grader
    Will display a message saying so.
Changed resubmits to detect based on if an assignment has been submitted more recently than it has been graded
    This means that resubmits are now only resubmits until they are graded
Fixed not reuploading gradebook when changing date on a grade
Fixed an issue with colors not being removed for resubmitted assignments after they were no longer resubmitted
